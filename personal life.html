    <p>Following the disbandment of Crisp in 1997, Sia decided to move to London to follow her first relationship with boyfriend Dan Pontifex. Several weeks later, while on a stopover in Thailand, she received the news that Dan had died after being in a car accident in London. Sia returned to Australia, but soon after returning she received a call from one of Dan's former housemates, who invited her to stay in London. Her 2001 album Healing Is Difficult lyrically deals with the death of Dan: "I was pretty fucked up after Dan died. I couldn't really feel anything. I could intellectualise a lot of stuff; that I had a purpose, that I was loved, but I couldn't actually feel anything." Sia recalled the effect of Dan's death in a 2007 interview for The Sunday Times: "We were all devastated, so we got shit-faced on drugs and Special Brew. Unfortunately, that bender lasted six years for me." 
In 2008, Sia discussed her sexual orientation in interviews with Scotland on Sunday and AfterEllen.com, and announced her relationship with JD Samson; they later broke up in 2011. She was included on a list of gay entertainers in the June–July 2009 issue of The Advocate. In both 2009 and 2010, Sia was nominated by readers of SameSame.com.au as one of the 25 most influential lesbian and gay Australians. When asked about her sexuality, she said, "Before I was actually successful I'd always said I've always dated boys and girls and anything in between. I don't care what gender you are, it's about people. I didn't just recently open up, I just recently got famous! I've always been... well, flexible is the word I would use."<br />
 
Sia has suffered from depression. She has said that she suffered from addiction to painkillers and alcohol, and had also contemplated suicide before, going as far as writing a suicide note.<br />
 
In June 2010, Sia's official website announced that all scheduled promotional events and shows had been cancelled due to her poor health. She cited extreme lethargy and panic attacks and considered retiring permanently from performing and touring. According to her Twitter account, she was diagnosed with Graves' disease – an autoimmune disorder characterized by an over-active thyroid. Four months later, in an ARIA Awards interview, Sia said her health was improving after rest and thyroid hormone replacement therapy.<br />

On 6 June 2014, Sia's engagement to documentary filmmaker Erik Anders Lang was announced by her mother. They were married at her home in Palm Springs, California, on 2 August 2014.<br />

During an appearance on The Howard Stern Show, Sia was asked if she was religious, to which she responded, "I believe in a higher power and it's called 'Whatever Dude' and he's a queer, surfing Santa that's a bit like my grandpa, so yes." In the same interview, Sia stated that she is a feminist and that Whatever Dude divinely inspired the lyrics she wrote for Rihanna's song "Diamonds".<br />

Sia is a cousin of popular Australian Christian rock musician Peter Furler.
